## About Me

Well you took the time to get here to my profile so I suppose I can provide a little bit about me, most call me Saintless/Saint, I enjoy gaming, learning, building, tinkering and really anything that involves technology. I've taught a lot of the things i've learned on my own through tons of reading, youtube, books, trial and error, etc. I usually break things when trying new things but dont we all at some point? By no means am I a proffesional programmer but rather someone with a drive and passion for learning all things tech, I enjoy helping out end users with their tech problems/questions and also educating them! Although most people don't care about the internals of how things work, they just know that it works so they don't need to worry about them. After the course of the last couple of years i've learned how hard programming really is and how it takes a strong base of dedicated people to build something from the ground up all from code! Developers never get the credit that is deserved but when a webpage breaks the first people they blame are the Devs, which is why I decided to shift gears into the vast deep rabbit hole of coding. Nerds rule the world and knowledge is power. 

- 🌐 **Web Development**: I am a Amateur(noob) in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started with these languages because it was first on the list and I figured it was a good basis for learning plus they are very versatile and can do more than just web development! 

- 🛠️ **Tech Support and System Administration**: My experience extends beyond coding. I've provided tech support, troubleshooted hardware and software issues, and built and maintained systems, setup cameras and networks for SOHO enviroments, build my own devices and computers, from the basics of a PC to learning how to reprogram a switch or phone. Whether it's setting up a new machine or optimizing an existing network, I thrive on solving technical challenges.

- 🔒 **Cybersecurity Awareness**: Security matters! I'm passionate about understanding and implementing best practices to protect digital assets. From encryption to secure coding, I keep security at the forefront of my work.

- 🐧 **Linux Enthusiast**: I love exploring different Linux distributions. Ubuntu is my go-to, but I've dabbled in Arch, Fedora, and more. The command line is my playground, and I enjoy scripting and automating tasks. I plan to eventually create my own distro one day for the experience and just a personal goal, but I have experience with all different types of OS and Enviroments from windows to iOS, android, etc. So far I only use Ubuntu because it works very well and it's smooth with my setup, most people hate the new snap package manager but I honestly don't mind it once it is setup and working right. 

## Tech Stack

Here's a glimpse of the tools and technologies I work with:

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little Python (Still learning to be efficient)
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text (Lightweight and simple)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub, Gitlab, I know there are others but this is just where I landed.
- **Operating System**: Linux (because penguins are cool 🐧... Sometimes) Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, ChromeOS/ChromiumOS
